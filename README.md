Purpose/Goal
------------
The goal of our website is to help incoming and current college students select suitable major. On the website we provide an overview of majors and guidance for the users to have an idea of what they would like to pursue long-term in their career versus navigating through an overwhelmingly large list of majors to choose from. The research will help any college student be prepared for their future endeavors by providing knowledge of careers they could envision themselves doing long-term. This also allows people to see the different type of careers that can be shared by a major.

 Elements of the Project
 ------------
This website has two components:
- dropdown → provides information on the careers available in the field, a description of the field, and a day in the life of people who work in the field to provide a holistic view of the major and the uses of the degree
- Search bar → for more specific access to majors, which saves time in searching for majors of interest

Languages
------------
HTML and CSS were used to create this website. Another language that can be embedded in an HTML file and allows us to add dynamic and interactive elements to our website is Javascript.For example, the drop-down menu and search bar are created using both CSS for styling and Javascript for the dynamic portion of those features.

Research Links/Database and Tools
------------
Research Database Aspects:
- Description → Provided UIUC’s own description regarding the major so users could better understand how this major is regarded at this university.
- Career → From there we wanted users to better understand what career is related to the prospective major, hence we included a link to possible job prospects for this major provided by the College Board.
- Day in the Life → for users to understand how daily life for a student/worker in this major is, we included a link to YouTube search results to “Day in the Life” videos.

   
Conclusion and Future Goals
------------
Our future goal for this website is to make it a more interactive experience for users. We may aim to conduct user research with our target audience and see what other information they may find useful on this website and incorporate that. Furthermore, we would like to allow users to compare different majors.
